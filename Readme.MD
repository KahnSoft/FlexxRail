## Project Overview

FlexxRail is a demonstrator for our OpenGL-based Industrial Vision Engine.  
Goal: To showcase the capabilities of our image processing software in complex 3D scenarios ‚Äì featuring dynamically generated terrain, railway tracks, moving locomotives, and Lua scripting.

At the core is a vast 3D terrain generated via Perlin noise and rendered using shaders and VBOs. With five elevation textures and gradients from the JetColor color space, we visualize topography similar to radar imaging.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Features

- Perlin terrain with JetColor elevation visualization  
- Spline-line editor for track layout  
- Locomotive simulation with wagons  
- Chunk system & frustum culling  
- Flora & fauna via geometry shaders *(in development)*  
- Lua scripting with debugger & breakpoints
